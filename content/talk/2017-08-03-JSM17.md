title = "Examining the Effect of a Pedagogical Change in a High Failure Rate College Science Course in the Face of a Shifting Demographic Student Body"
abstract = "This project enhances a current current Sustaining Success project designed to improve student performance in Chemistry 111 (increased GPA, decrease DWF rate) by providing a deeper look at the characteristics of who takes this course, and who passes this course. It is essential for faculty and administrators to have a holistic view of their students, and not consider the effects of changes such as a course redesign independent of other factors that affect student success. This project uses data mining techniques to examine historical trends and assess the impact of the redesign while controlling for other relevant factors."
