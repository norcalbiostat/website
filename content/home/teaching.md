### [Data](data/)
Wherever possible I try to use real world, non pre-processed data in the classroom. The [Data](data/) page provides links to download data, codebooks where available, and code to import these data sets into R. 


### [Notes](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/)
A compilation of Applied Statistics lecture notes using [[Bookdown]](https://bookdown.org/) that I use in multiple classes. Most of the examples are in R, some SPSS instructions or links to SPSS help pages sprinkled throughout.
